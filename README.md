# nginx-reverse-proxy

## Building

Run: `make image`

## Using

This docker image takes 3 optional arguments:
- REMOTE_HOST
-- This defaults to 'localhost' if unprovided
- REMOTE_PORT
-- This defaults to '8993' if unprovided
- LOCAL_CONTEXT
-- This defaults to '' if unprovided, must end in `/`, may need to be escaped, e.g. `-e 'LOCAL_CONTEXT=ddf\/'`

### NOTE:
After running the container following the example below, you will want to check what port got assigned to your machine for PAT to occur (`docker ps -a`).
Otherwise, you can statically define this by using the argument `-p 8443:8443` instead of including `-P` for automatic PAT assignments.

### Example:

```
~
matthew.bates@LinkMJBüç∫ $ docker run -e REMOTE_HOST=google.com -e REMOTE_PORT=443 -itP linkmjb/nginx-reverse-proxy:latest

### Accessing the desired endpoint via the reverse proxy
- `docker ps` (look for your container/service, and take note of the ports exposed. Generally the 1st port will map to http/80, and the 2nd will map to https/8443)
- Visit https://localhost:<https_port>/ in a web browser
